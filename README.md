# Prescription Bottle Reader
Many individuals, particularly those in the elderly community, struggle with
the size of the font written on medication bottles. This can result in individuals
taking their medication improperly, causing undesired side effects or limiting
the drugs functionality. As a means of mitigating this issue, we designed 
an algorithm used to extract the information written on prescription medication
bottles and portray the extracted text in a manner such that the font size can
be made larger for easier viewing.
